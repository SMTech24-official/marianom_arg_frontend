        Before 1988: Community Origins
      </Header>

      <p>
        In 1976, the first Girth &amp; Mirth chapter was founded in San
        Francisco by a chaser named Charlie Brown, providing the first-ever
        organized group for chubby gay men and their admirers. Other Girth &amp;
        Mirth clubs launched soon after, in Boston (in 1977) and New York (in
        1978), eventually spreading to every major metro area by the late 80s.
      </p>

      <p>
        While Girth and Mirth clubs did not have an explicit gainer identity
        (the terms &ldquo;gainer&rdquo; and &ldquo;encourager&rdquo; had yet to
        be coined), at the time they provided the only outlet for gay men who
        were interested in weight gain. Many Girth &amp; Mirth clubs were
        founded or led at various times by men who would later come to identify
        as gainers or encouragers.
      </p>

        />
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1982, a man named John Stone began printing what was the first ever
        publication explicitly for men into weight gain: Dragongate. Printed on
        a mimeograph in California, Dragongate featured stories, personal ads,
        photos and re-prints of a comic series called Judge Dredd, a sci-fi
        comic featuring obese characters quarantined on their own island.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the mid-80s, there were two ways for someone who was into weight gain
        to discover others like themselves: By attending a big men&rsquo;s
        meeting like Girth &amp; Mirth--where a handful of attendees might share
        their interest--or by finding personal or Dragongate ads in gay
        publications.
      </p>

      <p>
        During much of this time, the terms &ldquo;gainer&rdquo; and
        &ldquo;encourager&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t exist, so personal ads tended to
        specifically describe what the poster wanted. &ldquo;Have you ever
        fantasized about eating?&rdquo; read one ad placed in the New York
        Native (now defunct) in 1983.

      </p>

      <p>
        Around 1985, the first-known gathering of gainers and encouragers began
        in New York City, when a group started meeting informally after Girth
        &amp; Mirth meetings. One of the group&rsquo;s members, John Outcalt,
        would go on to be one of the gainer/encourager community&rsquo;s leading
        voices in the next decade. It was at one of these informal meetings that
        the terms &ldquo;gainer&rdquo; and &ldquo;encourager&rdquo; were
        proposed as standard terminology.

      <p>
        The late 80s were a formative time for the emerging gainer/encourager
        community, marking the widespread standardization of the terms
        &ldquo;gainer&rdquo; and &ldquo;encourager&rdquo;, the first regular
        organized gainer/encourager meetings, and the launch of a series of
        newsletters that would define the community in the pre-internet era.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1988, the informal group that had been meeting in New York City
        started holding regular meetings and events open to the public, branding
        itself the Encouragement Group and advertising their events around the
        city. That same year, the Encouragement Group held the first-ever weight
        gain discussion at the annual chub/chaser event Convergence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometime in the mid-80s, John Stone ceased publishing the Dragongate
        newsletter, leaving a hole in the nascent gainer/encourager community.
        In 1988, John launched a new newsletter, called XL, however he was
        forced to end it after only a year of publication due to his failing
        health. John passed his contact list to Ollie Lee Taylor in Florida,{" "}

        While common household internet access was still several years away,
        communications technology was improving rapidly in the late 80s. In
        1988, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was created, allowing those
        knowledgeable enough to create chat rooms and exchange text messages in
        real time.

        , an online messageboard for the Seattle chub-chaser community. Because
        it included a gainer/specific section, it quickly became the first
        website where gainers and encouragers start congregating online,
        preceding the AOL &ldquo;big belly M4M&rdquo; chat rooms by several
        years.

        In 1990, a 976 Gainer Hotline ad appeared in Big Ad magazine (a
        publication featuring chubby men) and ran for a year before lapsing into
        obscurity.

        In 1992, America Online began bringing the internet into homes of those
        significantly less tech savvy than the early adopters, with other
        companies following suit.

        Because the internet was still a new phenomenon, print outlets remained
        king during this time.

        By the mid-90s chat rooms became a go-to place for many gainers and
        encouragers. Chat rooms like #gaygainers on EFnet and &ldquo;Big Belly
        M4M&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fat and Gaining M4M&rdquo; on AOL brought together
        many non-tech-savvy gainers for the first time online.
      </p>

      <p>
        An earlier generation had discovered gaining and encouraging by
        attending Girth &amp; Mirth meetings or by stumbling on a personal ad or
        newsletter ad in a gay publication. Now, even before the launch of the
        first gainer website in 1996, a new generation was discovering that they
        were not alone through chat rooms and bulletin boards.

        Two years later, in April 1998, BellyBuilders.com was launched by
        DarkHorse, forming out of a discussion thread on the Korbel Microbrewing
        discussion board. Then in June of 1998, FatNats.com was launched,
        providing a space for a new generation of underage gainers and
        encouragers to explore their identity.

        Together, GainRWeb, BellyBuilders and FatNats ushered in a new era for
        gainers and encouragers. Through them, thousands of men with access to
        the increasingly user-friendly internet discovered that their desire to
        gain or encourage had a name&mdash;and was in fact shared by many
        others.

        ceased publication, with Porkers and Gainers Gazette and The Oinquirer
        having ended sometime before.

        After several years with little change in the online landscape, three
        new websites joined the mix in 2001: BallBellyBears.com; BigGuts.com;
        and TheOinquirer.com. Although none became as prominent as GainRWeb or
        BellyBuilders, they added alternative perspectives and experiences for
        the community at a time when the internet was still growing and being
        defined.
      </p>

      <p>
        2001 also saw the launch of Yahoo! Groups, which quickly became one of
        the most popular platforms for gainers and encouragers to share photos
        and stories. Each group could focus on a different topic&mdash;ranging
        from personal photo collections to groups built around admiring certain
        physical types.

        In August of 2002, the first ever documentary about gaining was released

        As the early 2000s progressed, the internet was moving forward at
        lightening speed, but the most popular gainer websites were run by
        volunteers who kept the sites afloat in their own free time and with the
        help of donations. The sheer amount of time required to make regular
        updates to Bellybuilders.com (which had to be done by hand) led Alan
        (DarkHorse) to transition the site to a simpler forum format and to pass
        the baton to Anthony (Lrgrthnlf).
      </p>

      <Header className="my-5 text-2xl">

      </Header>

      <p>
        2003 ushered in a new era for the gainer community with the launch of a
        single website: Beefyfrat.com. Launched by MattHess, in partnership with
        BradYates, BrianShifting, Bryan and TreyBien, Beefyfrat quickly became
        the most widely used website for gainers and encouragers.

        />
      </p>

      <p>
        For the next six years, there was very little disruption in the
        gainer/encourager website space. But the rest of the internet was
        experiencing disruption writ large. The launch of Skype (in 2003),
        Facebook (in 2004), YouTube (in 2005), and Twitter (in 2006) all
        profoundly affected the gainer and encourager community, connecting
        people over vast distances and in ways that were far more efficient and
        social than before.
      </p>

      <p>
        2003 was also a transition year for gainer events. The the last
        EncourageCon was held in 2003 in Palm Springs, gainer group meet ups in
        Los Angeles and San Francisco had lapsed and New York gatherings became
        sporadic. Small groups of gainers still met informally, but the larger
        community was in a state of flux.
      </p>

      <p>
        That was thanks in large part to the emerging power of the internet to
        bring people together virtually, thereby reducing the demand for
        in-person meetings. This same trend was seen in the chub/chaser
        community--by the early 2000s, most of the Girth &amp; Mirth clubs that
        had once thrived in every major U.S. city had lapsed or disbanded.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2004, a new gainer convention called Belly Weekend Atlanta began,
        largely picking up where EncourageCon left off. The event was led by
        Clayton (CigarChomp) and lasted for three years until, in 2007, it was
        re-branded as Expansion. This marked the first time that a gainer event
        was organized by someone who was not a part of the original core group
        of community leaders in the 90s.
      </p>

      <p>
        <Image
          className="my-5 max-sm:!w-[280px]"

          style={{ maxWidth: "440px", height: "auto" }}
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        Bolstered by the success of Expansion, several attempts were made the
        following year to establish gainer conventions internationally. Those
        included Southern Expanse in Melbourne, Australia (2008) and My Big Fat
        Birmingham Weekend (2008). Though both events were successful and proved
        there was regional interest, they were not attempted again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unlike the EncourageCons, which had exclusively been held in the
        northeast and California, Expansion stuck to locations in the southern
        U.S. After Expansion 2007 in Atlanta, the event started rotating, first
        to Orlando (in 2008), then New Orleans (in 2009) and Ft. Lauderdale (in
        2010).

        &rdquo; appeared on G4TV, a U.S. cable and satellite network, marking
        the first time gay gainers were openly discussed on mainstream
        television.

      <p>
        In October of 2009, GrowingGuys.com was launched by Dave (SFBig4Big),
        ushering in the social media age for gainer/encourager websites. The
        site utilized a generic social network template, bringing common social
        features (such as &ldquo;walls&rdquo; and comments) to the
        gainer/encourager community for the first time. Shortly thereafter,
        BeefyFrat added similar social features to its platform, expediting the
        social media shift.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a year in service and with 6,000 members, GrowingGuys was forced
        to shut down following the end of the service that provided its
        template. However it was around this time that larger numbers of gainers
        and encouragers were becoming comfortable enough to become
        &ldquo;friends&rdquo; on Facebook, providing yet another social
        community experience online.
      </p>

      <Header className="my-5 text-2xl">2011 - Present: The Social Era</Header>

      <p>
        2011 was another inflection point for the gainer community. On March 29,
        2011, Grommr.com was launched by PupKilo, SFBaydude02 and TreyBien. By
        2012 the site had become the most widely used among gainers and
        encouragers with over 50,000 members.

      </p>

      <p>
        Gainer events were also seeing another shift in 2011, with the arrival
        of a second annual gainer convention (Belly Rub Weekend in Chicago), as
        well as a new, program coordinated by Grommr&rsquo;s founders for
        fostering local meet ups around the world (called GrommOffs).
      </p>

      <p>
        Belly Rub Weekend Chicago grew out of a gainer picnic held in 2010, and
        provided a new model for gainer events. Rather than focusing on a hotel
        venue&mdash;as EncourageCon and Expansion had done&mdash;BRW focused on
        events and meals held throughout the city, quickly becoming a popular
        annual event.
      </p>

      <p>
        <Image
          className="my-5 max-sm:!w-[280px]"

          style={{ maxWidth: "440px", height: "auto" }}
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        By early 2011, regular local meet ups were sporadic and most were
        organized privately, among friends. Shortly after the launch of Grommr
        in March, 2011, the GrommOff program began, marking the first attempt at
        coordinated local gainer events since the Encouragement movement in the
        early 90s.
      </p>

      <p>
        GrommOffs were designed as informal gatherings organized by local
        leaders or visiting coordinators, oftentimes featuring bar nights,
        dinners, brunches, picnics or other social outings. By the end of 2011,
        53 GrommOffs had been held in 27 cities in four countries on three
        continents.
      </p>

      <p>
        2011 also saw the launch of the first-ever gainer podcast. Hosted by
        Pete (GainTirade) and his partner Matt (NojoArtist), the GainTirade
        podcast featured regular guests and address various issues affecting
        gainers and encouragers. Just over a year later in December 2012 a
        second podcast--

        --began, hosted by Russ (Fatfanplus) and his boyfriend Steve (Munchy).
      </p>

      <p>
        2012 saw both a second BRW in Chicago and a fifth Expansion (held in New
        Orleans), as well as another 101 GrommOffs held in 38 cities in six
        countries on three continents.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also in 2012, a new gainer event model was established: Gainer Camp in
        Seattle. A selective, all-expenses-paid week-long experience, Gainer
        Camp was organized by Stuart (TipTheScales) and provided a custom,
        small-scale approach to gainer events&mdash;the first two camps, held
        back-to-back, had five attendees each. Stuart would go on to start
        Gainer House--a private home in Seattle that became a hub for many local
        gainers.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2013, a sixth Expansion in Austin, a third BRW in Chicago and a
        second Gainer Camp in Seattle were held. Also, a total of 91 GrommOffs
        were held in 34 cities in eight countries on five continents. Two
        GrommOffs that year became the first-ever gainer gatherings in South
        America (in Buenos Aires in February, 2013) and Asia (in Bangkok in
        June, 2013).

        se-xual interests.

      <p>
        In 2014, BRW continued on in Chicago with a fourth event and Expansion
        held its seventh event in Nashville, TN. 2014 also saw the first-ever
        large coordinated gainer event in Europe. Hosted by the founders of
        Grommr, EuroGrom established a new model, with most meals and activities
        based around a party loft and several sightseeing excursions. The event
        brought together over 90 people from 12 countries.

        2015 saw a fifth BRW held in Chicago and Expansion returned to the Hotel
        Provincial in New Orleans (its third and final time at the hotel).
      </p>

      <p>
        In January of 2016 a new website called Gainrtube appeared--the first
        new website for gainers and encouragers since 2011. Run by a webmaster
        who insisted on anonymity, the site allowed members to upload videos
        without the content restrictions and flagging of sites like YouTube. On
        March 2, 2106, Gainrtube disappeared without any explanation, though it
        is believed the high cost of hosting so much video content quickly
        became unsustainable.
      </p>

      <p>
        2016 was also the end of an era. After 12 years of event organizing--and
        being the only large gainer event for six of those years--Clayton
        (CigarChomp) decided to retire Expansion. The ninth and final Expansion
        was held in Tampa.

      <p>
        BRW also held its sixth event in Chicago in 2016, promising to continue
        on as the sole large U.S. gainer event. And the Grommr Team organized a
        second EuroGrom in Berlin in 2016, bringing together over 85 people from
        20 countries.

        The Gainer Community Report utilizes data from Grommr and was compiled
        as a service to the gainer-encourager community. The goal of this report
        is to collect and analyze publicly available data to help foster a
        deeper understanding of who we are as a community&mdash;how we identify,
        what we like, where we live and what we want for ourselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        We realize that this report only scratches the surface, and we hope it
        will be a precursor to future efforts to quantify and analyze this
        complex community of ours.
      </p>

      <p>
        All data has been filtered to exclude old and inactive profiles, as well
        as recently created ones. The data within the report shows information
        only from Grommr profiles that have both been members for at least 30
        days and have logged in within the last nine months.
      </p>

      <p>
        All data available in this interactive report is drawn from profile
        information provided by Grommr members that is publicly visible within
        Grommr. No private or sensitive member data was used in the creation of

        If You Like Fat Guys, Try Texas...
      </Header>

      <p>
        Grommr is much fatter than the average community, but if you like your
        men really chubby, you may need to go south. It turns out that whether
        you like paunches, big beer guts or huge flabby bellies, the place to be
        is actually Texas. Among the top 25 cities for active Grommr members,
        the 10 cities with the fattest of fat men are:
      </p>

      <p>
        With a media BMI of 34, fatboys abound in the United Arab Emirates, the
        chunkiest country on Grommr (second-place-tying Finland and the U.S. lag
        behind with a median BMI of only 31). Here&rsquo;s the top 10 countries
        with the fattest men and biggest bellies (among countries with more than
        10 profiles):

        Grommr is a Single, Obese 27 Year Old
      </Header>

      <p>
        OK, not literally. But the median age on Grommr is 27, the median BMI is
        30.1, and single people make up 76 percent of all active members. What
        does that mean? It means Grommr skews young, obese and single. Half of
        Grommr is under age 27 and three out of four Grommr members are single,
        two factors that are related since younger Grommr members are
        disproportionately more likely to be single (the share of single members
        decreases among older members, reaching a low of ~60 percent among those
        over age 55). A median BMI of 30.1 puts Grommr just over the edge from
        &ldquo;overweight&rdquo; to &ldquo;obese.&rdquo; That also means that
        half of Grommr is well into the obese or morbidly obese category. Good
        job fat guys, now who&rsquo;s up for a buffet?

      <Header className="my-5 text-2xl">We Like Working with Our Hands</Header>

      <p>
        Gainer se-x is complex. When it comes to se-xual interests, four of the
        top five interests are non-normative activities with an emphasis on
        touch and tactile experience, with &ldquo;belly play&rdquo; leading the
        list. The top five se-xual interests are:
      </p>

      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>Belly play</li>
          <li>Cuddling</li>
          <li>Mutual masterbation</li>
          <li>Oral (receiver)</li>
          <li>Feeding (feeder)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p>
        That&rsquo;s not to say Grommr doesn&rsquo;t enjoy anal se-x, just that
        we as a community appear to be more likely to enjoy what could be termed
        &ldquo;gainer se-x,&rdquo; centered around rubbing bellies and exploring
        our growing bodies. Go figure.
      </p>

      <Header className="my-5 text-2xl">
        It Turns Out, We Really Like Big Bellies
      </Header>

      <p>
        Like really. Among the body parts we like, bellies rank as the clear
        winner (almost 50 percent), with asses trailing a distant second (38%).
        This will come as a surprise to no one who&rsquo;s spent even 10 seconds
        in the photo feed, which features prominent round or flabby bellies more
        than any other body part. We like big butts we cannot lie, but
        it&rsquo;s big guts that really seem to rule the day.
      </p>

      <Header className="my-5 text-2xl">
        Not Everyone Want to be Immobile
      </Header>

      <p>
        While immobility remains a fantasy for many on Grommr, we can finally
        put to rest the myth that all gainers wish to gain to immobility. Based
        on profile data, the vast majority of those with a weight goal on Grommr
        have one well below 160 kg (~350 pounds) and very few have real-life
        goals to gain beyond 230 kg (~500 pounds) into superchub territory. This
        isn&rsquo;t to kink shame anyone who fantasizes or wants to be an
        immobile superchub--that fantasy is shared by around 10 percent of
        active Grommr members--simply to point out that such goals represent
        only one part of the wide spectrum of weight gain goals. Some of us want
        a little belly flab, some of us want a huge beer gut, and some of us
        want to be superchubs. It&rsquo;s all good.
      </p>

      <Header className="my-5 text-2xl">Gainer Dating is Complex</Header>

      <p>
        Even though Grommr is partly a dating site, the results are split among
        what Grommr members want. Just over 75 percent of Grommr members say
        they are single, yet only around 28 percent are looking for a
        relationship and 31 percent are looking for dates. By contrast, 52
        percent of Grommr members are looking for friends and 41 percent are
        looking for online chat. That means a lot of single gainers and
        encouragers are looking for dates and relationships, but some are simply
        looking for friends or online connection. Gainer dating, it appears, is
        as complex as gainer se-x.

      <Header className="my-5 text-2xl">College Towns are Tough</Header>

      <p>
        College can be a time when novice young gainers first begin the journey
        to becoming fatboys. So it&rsquo;s not a big surprise that the locations
        with the lowest BMIs among Grommr members are disproportionately college
        towns, which make up six of the 10 skinniest Grommr cities in the U.S.:
      </p>

      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>Ithaca, NY (Cornell and Ithaca College)</li>
          <li>Palo Alto, CA (Stanford)</li>
          <li>Madison, WI (UW-Madison)</li>
          <li>Berkeley, CA (UC Berkeley)</li>
          <li>Irvine, CA (UC Irvine)</li>
          <li>Bloomington, IN (IU Bloomington)</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p>
        That doesn&rsquo;t mean the freshman 15 is a myth, just that it appears
        to be dwarfed by the post-college 50.

        Growth-specific Kinks Rule the Day
      </Header>

      <p>
        Among kinks it&rsquo;s no surprise that the top five is dominated by
        ones that deal with growth explicitly:
      </p>

      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>Tight Clothes/Button Popping</li>
          <li>Belly Buttons/Navels</li>
          <li>Underwear</li>
          <li>Bloating</li>
          <li>Muscle Growth</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <p>
        As the list goes on, though, many non-growth kinks have a strong
        showing, with daddy-son role play; uniforms; businessmen; immobility;
        and wrestling/singlets rounding out the top 10. Beyond that, popular
        growth kinks include messy eating (11th); belching (13th); and stretch
        marks (14th).

        Less Popular Kinks Dominate Newsfeed Searches
      </Header>

      <p>
        One surprise was how relatively low on the kinks list certain kinks
        fell. Kinks that often dominate the &ldquo;Top Newsfeed Searches&rdquo;
        (e.g. mpreg, vore, exploding bellies) on Grommr represented a relatively
        small share of overall kinks. It appears that the prevalence of newsfeed
        searches may actually be an indicator of a kink&rsquo;s rarity, more
        than its popularity: If it&rsquo;s harder to find content or people
        related to mpreg or vore, the newsfeed search represents one of the only
        ways to find it.
