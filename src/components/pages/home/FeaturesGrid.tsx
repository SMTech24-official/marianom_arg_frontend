          Location is everything. So of course we built Grommr with powerful
          location tools. When you add your location to your profile by entering
          a city name, zip/postal code, or even an address (don&#39;t worry,
          your exact location will always remain private), the system will
          automatically calculate and display to other members your approximate
          relative distance to other people. This way, you can see who&#39;s
          close to you, and whether you would like to meet them locally, have in
          your Chicago and London, you want to be sure to find the fatties in
          your area, not just somewhere in the same vast city. You can do that
          on Grommr!

          answer it. Unless you specifically delete them, conversations are kept
          forever. And if you want to know whether the people you&#39;re talking
          to are in for a live chat, you can just keep adding replies to the
          conversation timeline. The replies you receive will instantly be shown
          to you, just like in a chat. No need to keep refreshing the inbox.

          of privacy, all sensitive data such as your birthdate, email address,
          and location are kept private by default. You can also prevent
          specific users from accessing your profile and content. Lastly, if
          you&#39;re done with your dating journey, you can easily delete your
          profile and all of your content will be permanently removed, no
          questions asked.
